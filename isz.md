# Part No. 1

## Bigger Servers:
- Bigger servers with roughly 30-40 players would bring so much to the table it's not even funny.
- Being able to play with clans/factions and sniper shootouts, is an insanely good idea that will keep the community hooked.

## Randomly spawning loot:
- With the trailer showcasing the City in, for a lack of a better word, it's entirety it seems loot should be scattered inside not only buildings but in cars, pileups, barricades, windmills, etc.

## Environment Variety:
- The lack of variety in ISZ's environment was terrible.
- Add weather conditions, like a heavy rain, blizzard, lite snow, sunny tundra, and lite rain.

## Add More Idle Hazards:
- Let's face it, the temperature in ISZ is more of a suggestion if you can't find shelter. Slowly draining your health (~1hp/min).
- Make temperature variable, days/nights should range in temps (I'm thinking between -32 and +8).

## Add Unlockable:
- One of the main reasons players don't stick around too long in ISZ as well is because of the lack of progression.
- Make skins/cosmetics/emotes unlockable or add a levelling system for each day survived/players-killed/zombies-killed that is ranked.
- Gain XP/Money for cosmetics and a global leader-board to show who is the true survivor, or "badges" for the player instead of EXP.
- Also allow players to unlock possible UI changes like maybe a "frosty theme" for all the UI or background image/animation for the title-screen.

## Remove Friending, Add Factions:
- Friending is tedious and time consuming.
- There should be user created factions that should only carry at most 12 players and are "invite only", and are auto-applied as friendly when joining the same server.

## Add Weapon Mods:
- Players have always wanted to customize there Weapons using Mods.
- Add simple mods to all weapons like a "Mag-Expander", a variety of "scopes", and maybe a "silencer".

# Part No. 2

## Remove Blacklisting:
- Blacklisting in the original ISZ is a good idea on paper, but doesn't work with multiplayer in-mind.
- Instead add a "Block" that will block the Player's communications per-player. And NOT prevent the blocked player from joining a server.

## Improved Texting:
- ISZ's Texting is bad, both on PC, and Nintendo Switch (3DS was perfect).
- Redo the keyboard so typing is more user-friendly on console, and disable moving when typing on PC.
- Also if on PC, Disable the popup keyboard GUI, and allow all valid ascii characters (not utf-8 or utf-16).

## Improved Movement:
- There is no running in any of the ISZ-2021 games.
- Why not add a system for not only walking in CSZ, but also add counterweights.
- If a player runs for too long (like 10+ seconds) then there walk is slower and accuracy is inhibited by a larger crosshair biased on the time spent above the stamina bar.
- And cannot run until the stamina bar goes fully back down, as well as making zombies run faster if the player is spotted or seen running instead of walking.
- Crouching shouldn't prone the player directly to ground either, instead it should be a toggle between Standing, Crouching, and going Prone.

## Give Zombies More AI:
- The AI in the current zombies is absolutely terrible, let's face it.
- Add the ability for zombies to hear gunshots, alert others, and form huge hordes of Zombies to attack huge groups of Players in a Given Area (makes sense for a city).
- Update movement to be corresponding with the player, zombie should speed-up if player starts to sprint/run, or walk.
- They also should not just track players through solid objects. Instead, if a player is spotted, and runs away from a zombie and goes around a corner.
- Instead of tracking them nonmatter what, go to the last place the player was seen, and do a standard search routine while also at a faster walk pace.

# Part No. 3

## Player Landscapes/Landmarks/Naming/Map:
- Players had to originally create landmarks using stuff like "centre-tree" and "rocks" to mark the land, add name-tags to the map so players can accurately describe locations, and landmarks.
- Should also be able to toggle names on/off with a button combination rather than always being active or tied to a certain menu.

## More Settings:
- Be able to change settings like Bloom, Motion Blur, FOV, Gamma, Game-Chat (both Voice-Chat and Texting).
- Add PC Exclusive Features such as being able to snap to the correct resolution and apply UI elements to UW, or 4:1 displays. And Changing Resolution, VSync, and FPS Max/Locking.

## UI Ideas:
- Add Mouse, and Keyboard support if a console supports it for games. Same on PC.

## Better Animations:
- The animations in ISZ2021 where kind of Janky.
- Make more natural animations, kinda like the Zombie animation from ISZ2021 (felt and looked natural like a zombie normally would look like running).
