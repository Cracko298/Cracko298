- **Head Developer of Multiple Projects Including a VideoGame-Model-Editor, Audio-Injector and something else to rule the world...**

:wave: **Hi I'm Phin, I create tools to better help with Game Modding, Understanding Obscure Formats, and Hacking. I know a multitude of Languages, and I am a Backend Developer at Heart.**

**I started off because I wanted to know how Games and Applications read/wrote data. And how each of them can be exploited to load my own Stuff such as Audio, Models, and New Content.**

**My favorite language to write is C, right next to Python. I have 8+ years of experience, and am fully self taught.**
